My name is Bilal Khan. I'm currently pursuing Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (3rd year). Machine Learning has been exciting and this page reflects projects which are a result of self-learning. I strongly believe that artificial intelligence is a revolution and i'm keen in contributing through AI to a better world. Cheers.
